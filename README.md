Transform exported zendesk xml files to csv files

Zendesk lets you export your data in a number of formats. One of them is XML. This is a simple script that
reads two of those files, users.xml, and tickets.xml, and saves them in a CSV form. (Zendesk also lets you
export as CSV, but I'm told it's not the full set of data.)

Simple little program to play around with rust.
